      This is my rambling and ranting space for special or maybe even mundane moments and sometimes unorganised thoughts. I tend to go on tangents and won't really try to be fully coherent or grammatically correct so entries may be lengthy just for nothingburger. Uhh if you know me in real life, STAY OUT!!

        <h3><time datetime="2025-11-30">2025-11-30</time>: nikki.top</h3>
        <div class="a">
          <p><time datetime="13:58">13:58</time>: ok im going to rant a bit here but i mean nothing against Verbrechen or anyone working on <a target="_blank" href="https://nikki.top/index.php">nikki.top</a>, i just have gripes with it as a user of this service. i think i first discovered nikki on r/neocities and in concept i really liked the idea of being able to just embed this iframe instead of manually typing in entries into my editor. i still do and prefer to write longer entries like this manually into the editor but sometimes i just want to say a short blurb or two which i really cannot be bothered to pull up in the editor for. another benefit of using this website is that i can easily access it and post from my phone. i can technically also access the neocities editor from my phone but i simply dont want to, its a fricking pain. basically, nikki is a good idea. not exactly original, but i havent really explored other embeddable blogging things.</p>
          <p>with that being said, i have some issues with the overall ux. of course, im not well versed in web design but these are things that personally peeve me. firstly, the pages are a not very connected. since the post page is what i usually reach for, i bookmarked that page. however, sometimes i want to access the main site which is a bit tedious because there is no home button on the post page so i have to manually delete post.php from the address bar. this applies to all the other pages you can access from the homepage, except for the profile page, that one is special, i guess.</p>
          <p>secondly, the forums. i first went there a few days ago and it vexes me. the first thing i noticed was that the font colour (purple) was not very readable against the black background. i just checked on <a target="_blank" href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">webaim.org's contrast checker</a> and it completely fails. i dont have the best eyesight so it is quite a problem for me. i saw someone else on the forum point it out but you can only ever see the 4 most recent posts. you cant even see that post because it became the fifth most recent post so i guess it's just lost to the void. this hardly feels like a forum, to be honest. well, im no frequenter of forums but in my experience forums have the post titles then you click on it for the full thread. you do set a title for posts but i dont know where they go. im assuming the lack of use for the post titles is because posts are on the most recent section. this forum has been up for like a month so im assuming there are more features planned for it in the future which may explain its current state.</p>
          <p>this is less of a gripe and more like a hope but i wish this site was responsive. using it on mobile is quite odd because of the size of the text box. its either i zoom out and cant see what im typing or i zoom in and cant see what ive typed as a whole. its not a big issue, but i nitpick.</p>
          <p>i just wanted to rant about this a bit. idk if there was more i wanted to say but this is it for now. generally, nikki is a good concept, the excecution just fails in certain areas which i happen to be quite annoyed with. it has some intersting features, im particularly interested in the existence of a private messaging system. i didnt think that would be something available on a site like this considering that i personally see this site more like <a target="_blank" href="https://status.cafe/">status.cafe</a> but with no character limit and less of a social site where i would want to talk with people but that's cool. ok bye.</p>
          <p>Edit <time datetime="2025-12-1">1 Dec </time>: I notice that the dates don't follow my own timezone... I just made a post and the date on it is still 30 Nov but it is already 1 Dec for me.</p>

        <h3><time datetime="2025-11-28">2025-11-28</time>: prom</h3>
        <div class="a">
          <p><time datetime="12:20">12:20</time>: the movies lied. prom isnt all that. im writing this on a friday but actually prom was last monday i just couldnt really be bothered to write about it before. idk how prom is in other countries, but literally my only impression of prom was from movies. many months ago i was kind of looking forward to prom? i wanted to fulfill my fashion dreams but i dont think i was excited for prom itself. especially as it got closer, i really couldnt imagine what was going to happen and because of that i moreso felt dread. i didnt really want to see my schoolmates tbh, ive drifted from pretty much everybody ive made friends with except my current friends. my friends were coming over before prom so we could get ready and play a bit together so i was more worried about that than prom itself. that part was okay, i liked playing with my friends. it was the first time i hosted my own friends. ever. at my big age :laughing crying emoji:</p>
          <p>so i was already dreading prom, and i was immediately overwhelmed when i entered the venue. there were a few things i was really worried that if happened i would literally kill myself socially. everyone else was dressed amazing, i was totally outdressed. the emcee makes me want to choke myself sometimes. he opened the event with a 67 JOKE. WHO IS THIS UNC. its not like ive never made a 67 joke. in fact i may do it to an extreme extent at times. but at least im hip and young #fellowkids. we started with bingo and this guy is like "if you have a bingo, you must shout 67 and everyone else at the table must do the hand gesture" :skull emoji: also i found out later on that every table was given the same card so #rigged amiright. i think after that they let us eat the buffet. it was okay, nothing special.</p>
          <p>the order of events is blurry for me, it was almost two weeks ago after all. there was this lucky draw thing. i think everyone was automatically added as participants and a lot of people just got random vouchers, but the higher prizes were like vouchers to resorts world sentosa?? hello?? insane stuff. there was word search that was the part i was most engaged in. we were nowhere close to winning though lol. oh yeah the most important part: beauty pageant. idk how the participants were chosen but one person from each class was a nominee then they answered questions. we got to vote for the 3 finalists but the actual prom queen was chosen by the judges. the other two got to be prom princesses at least. nglllll was it a beauty pageant.. or a popularity contest. actually it might be more of a charisma contest, but those people are also the most popular lol.</p>
          <p>thats like about it. it was 2.5 hours and it ended late enough that we couldnt really do much of anything after the event. afterwards everyone was mostly taking pictures. i didnt really take many pictures tho, unless other people asked for one. i didnt even post pictures of me. yeeeeahhhhhhhhh. i wasnt very engaged or had people i wanted to see so maybe that contributed to my boredom. dude now that i think about it i think i havent left the house in a week (since last thursday) aggggghhhh. ive been saying i want to go out but i dont think i actually want to. the loneliness migggght be getting to me but ive been lonely for like at least two years now so this is normal. just gotta focus on my hobbies. ok ciel out it took me like an hour to write this to tell you how MID prom was.</p>

        <h3><time datetime="2025-11-23">2025-11-23</time>: im fucking emo</h3>
        <div class="a">
          <p>hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</p>
          <p>ok writing directly into the editor makes me go on tangents more wahhhhhh wahhhhhh thats why this is a journal and not a blog :wink: ok anyway i just uploaded <a target="_blank" href="ocs/personas/media/index.html">sona comic 4</a> which has suicide in it, my sona jumps off a cliff. i literally thought of it at 11pm last night and i knew i couldnt wait for the morning to draw it so i stayed up until like 2am drawing it. anyway i was literally just thinking oh my god i want to kill myself (not in a suicidal way just uh yeah anyway) and i thought like what if aime went and killed himself then like the rest just kinda of came naturally. the ending i orginally came up with and stuck to was that aimee says she still feels his presence, however i did consider a different ending where aimee goes "what did he look like again?" which is just for extra angst but part of why i didnt go with it was because i couldnt bother to think of a way to phrase it in the way aimee talks that was succinct enough so i left it as is.</p>
          <p>the reason im writing this entry is because like halfway drawing this thing i think when i started considering that alternate ending i realised this might accidentally be like a vent(for lack of better word) comic. like for years now i remember as far back as 12 years old, on and off ive always thought about my own death and how people would react. i'd imagine the reactions of people i know to my own death like would they cry? would they be sad? how long would they grieve? and over the years ive had more experiences related to death like my classmate died, my grandmother died, so ive had a few more opportunities to observe how people react to death which helps in a bad way because i wonder if people will say bad things or speculate the details of my death which sucks. maybe this is normal idk just saying my own experience.</p>
          <p>what this comic specifically tackles is my fear that noone would notice my death. idk the past year or so while it isnt like very serious whenever i leave the house or do anything that is mildly dangerous in the back of my mind i imagine a scenario where i'll die like the bus crashes or im violent murdered or slip in the shower and i'll imagine that my family wont know or realise until its too late to even possibly save me. my friends would probably find out even later. in the comic aimee just comes to aime's house like normal and says she'll wait. she is unaware that aime is never coming back on his own. this is a bit different from my own fears because in aimee's case she will probably wonder where aime is and wander around to find him (next comic possibly?) but i fear that noone gives a flip and doesnt even notice at all so maybe aime has i better, huh.</p>
          <p>aime did not necessarily have to die by suicide and i dont really have a reason for why he does but well i already drew it in by the time i realised it. i think suicide is a bit of a different alley than a death that wasnt self-induced. death happens all the time for various reasons, often unexpected and sudden, and most importantly, out of one's control. but suicide is entirely intentional, noone does that by accident and usually there is something that drives people to consider suicide. i have no experience with suicide so i may be wrong but i feel like when a death is by suicide, people will wonder more about the reason behind it and how it couldve been avoided. i guess if its, say, an accident, people will also wonder how it couldve been avoided. but an accident is not always predictable, unlike suicide which is premeditated. so i wonder if aimee ever finds out aime is dead, will she wonder if its her fault or if she couldve helped him.</p>
          <p>the alternate ending is what i imagine to be reality for me. will people even remember me when im gone? i never really left a deep impression, or at least that's what i think, idk if you ask some people. the actual/hopeful ending is what i hope will happen, i guess. im not back reading this i hope i made sense ya.</p>

        <h3><time datetime="2025-11-11">2025-11-11</time>: disappear</h3>
        <div class="a">
          <p>its that time of the year again..!!! the time where my feelings of wanting to disappear get a little too real and i start going MiA online. im someone who usually overshares on the internet like i have a whatsapp status i have pikidiary and usually i tend to be quite active in these places. i dont text people that often because well the people closest to me (which is like 2) can just see what im up to from these other places. but recently after like my exams finished and stuff ive kind of had a lot less to say so naturally i havent been posting as much. it even feels weird to post idk i just feel unnecessarily awkward about it. as a chronic oversharer its during these times when i overthink more about what i share and whether its necessary. so sometimes when im not posting as much anyway or i posted a lot the previous day i even make it a point on to post. which is me right now my streak is currently 1 day (a whole 24 hours). i started doing this kinda thing last year already and i guess i am really insecure so i always wonder if people notice im gone. would anyone really care if i disappeared for a bit. i made the mistake of expressing this on my status and my friend said they noticed. unfortunately my brain tells me everyone is a fucking liar so i cant believe it. i suck i know. this current one cant keep up for long anyway since prom is next week so im meeting my friends and im probably going to post about it but for now at least im going to act like i dont exist. my longest streak of going MiA was almost a week, short by a few hours because i was undisciplined. i was actively ignoring messages btw and im the type to usually respond to messages quickly. maybe this is a really toxic thing of me to do. maybe thats why my friend (that same friend) sent me a random message.. why do i keep doing this. why do i keep feeling this way. there are people who care about me but why do i pretend they dont exist. why do i pretend that i dont exist. anyway im still going to keep this up its not like i have anything to say. maybe its weird that im saying im disappearing but im still here but idk my website is a little more private, weirdly. like its not guaranteed anyone will see it especially if i delete the update on my neocities profile.</p>
          <p>honestly this is just the holiday mood for me. i always feel kind of depressed which might be because ive suddenly been taken out of my normal routine. which is weird because i was also kind of depressed being in the routine but at least i had regular social interaction.</p>
          <p>ah idk if i like writing here tbh i always get kind of distracted and sometimes i transition into another point when theres still more to say about the previous one. im just not good at fully expressing myself but whatever gets the job done i guess. i just feel like everyone's fed up with my shit man, disappearing every so often, being so moody and only thinking of my self. in my own world. id be tired of myself tbh idk how my friends put up with this.</p>
          <p>im really hungry right now. having all the cravings. sleeping doesnt seem very.. appealing (its 11.35pm right now). man maybe theres more i could be doing right now but i know taking care of my health is important so ill probably try to sleep after this. is this all i wanted to say? okay. good night.</p>

        <h3><time datetime="2025-09-26">2025-09-26</time>: secondary school graduation</h3>
        <div class="a">
          <p>Preface: im not an good  writer im just recounting so theres probably gonna be lots of “and then”s, simple sentence structures and skipping things that dont have much to describe imo</p>
          <p>today i graduated secondary school. yes i did cry. in the morning we had a paraliturgy (because this is a catholic school) for both everyone's exams and the secondary 4 graduation. after that i had my very last recess break in school &lt;/3 at least i had fun with my friends. i drank a fruit punch with jelly, a drink i had refused to try until the end of last term (3 weeks ago) its really a good drink i drank it, i feel like it brought me closer to my friends, the way how we frantically finish eating our jelly before the end of recess bell rings &lt;3 we were almost late to class almost every day this term (past 2 weeks). its really something precious, considering i used to be the type that would wonder why people would take so long to get back to class from recess, but now i know and im one of them &lt;3 during recess my cca (co-curricular activity) junior approached me and gave me a letter. i have yet to read it and other letters but i will after typing this.</p>
          <p>after recess was this prize presentation ceremony for cca achievements and rehearsal for the graduation ceremony that evening. not much to say about this part, it was pretty boring i guess. when we came back to class everyone was signing each other's shirts and notebooks. i regret not doing something similar, i didnt even make notes even though i normally wouldve. i thought hm ill still be seeing these guys i can just do it at prom but no!! graduation is NOW!!!!! ugh whatever i told my friends i loved them on <a target="_blank" href="https://pikidiary.lol/posts/273618">pikidiary</a> at least. my two friends and i filmed a few tiktok drafts which would transition into our prom fits eventually. after that we headed out to lunch and yada yada not much to say yeah.</p>
          <p>when we came back everyone else in our class was already getting ready so we went to change into our formal uniform. a lot of people were doing braids and ehh its the last day so fuck it do something fancy. i tried to braid my friends hair but it didnt turn out that well but it was okay i guess. they tried to braid mine but um it failed and i managed to do a small braid into a ponytail myself.. sorry to them 💔💔 we went down to gather and oh it was really happening!! we were waiting for our walk-in on the ceremony.</p>
          <p>before i knew it the moment had finally arrived. i was walking down the aisle of the school hall with all my classmates and friends for OUR graduation ceremony. when we walked in i felt like a zoo animal because parents and teachers from both sides were holding their phones up and close taking pictures. they gave us an led candlelight to hold up during our walk-in. when we sat down there was a goodie bag and stuff for us.</p>
          <p>The ceremony started with some catholic stuff like scripture reading and hymns (wasnt called anything in particular so idk). after that there was the address by the principal and our assistant year head. the latter almost made me cry, i really love her she's an amazing teacher. Maybe it was more impactful because ive actually been taught by her and shes really a nice teacher.</p>
          <p>Alas, the main event: the presentation of graduation bears. Each student goes up and receive their graduation plushie bear which dons our school uniform and a graduation cap. This is meant to juxtapose the welcome bear we were given when we first came to this school 4 years ago. I clapped so much at this segment (and the other segments and in the morning too, lots of clapping and cheering).</p>
          <p>after the presentation of graduation bears, it was time for student speeches. there were two and tbh this was almost about to be the thing that made me break. i was already like almost tearing from the start but this part just resonated with me so much i was holding back tears. After the speeches, they showed us a video from our teachers wishing us well. each department made their own separate videos and when i saw the mother tongue departmen's i teared, but havent fully cried yet.</p>
          <p>Then, they brought out our letters to ourself and from our parents. i read the letter from my parents and goddddd. dear God i have been blessed with good parents i love them so much i am so grateful for them. then i read the letter i had written to myself at the start of the year (they made everyone do this) i totally forgot about this.. the contents still deeply resonate with me. The first thing i asked was about neocities because at that time i had been starting out my first website and was really focussed on getting it up. so to past me, yes! It is up! And im journalling on it right now! The other goals are still things i wish to work towards. idk if that means im still the same person or i havent progressed. hm. it is quite disappointing but also its like im listening to a version of myself who has yet to know the future. perhaps i could adopt future self letter writing in the years to come, even though im not “forced” to for school. i think its a nice thing.. yeah. it was when i started reading these letters that i finally cried. cried because i felt loved, cried because the reality of the passage of time had settled in, cried because it was all real.</p>
          <p>Amidst everyone bawling, we were asked to stand for our school song. I wish i could sing my school song but it contains religious stuff which dont align with my beliefs. I at least sang the one line i could say though, as earnest as i could with tears in my eyes. They then played another school song (like a school spirit song i guess) and i sang it with my heart. Ive been in this school community for 10 years already, who knows when id get to sing my heart out to this song together with everyone ever again. Everyone locked arms and swayed while singing, i felt like i was somewhere i belonged all along. At the end of a song, they popped streamers wow!! When i thought it would end it just kept going and going they kept popping more lol.</p>
          <p>We couldnt sit down yet though. Everyone turned to the parents section and gave a big loud thank you. The parents were dismissed to go to dinner downstairs but the graduands still had to stay to take class photos. I wanted to stand near my friends but i ended up at the back even though im really short so i dont think i was very visible (a bit regrettable.. oh well). After that we went upstairs to our classroom to get our belongings and my friends and i took a few pics too (the one i posted on pikidiary included). Then we headed down to eat the dinner buffet. we ate dinner together. i didnt eat much because i wasnt very hungry. no appetite from all the emotions i guess. after we ate, we hugged, did a hand thing, and took a not-so-final pic together. </p>
          <p>I was on my way home. It was all over. I didnt talk to my mother on the ride home. I was posting about graduation on pikidiary. Im writing half of this the morning after (sept 27). I feel.. nothing. I actually didnt even cry that much yesterday. I had tears, but they werent flowing. i dont know why i dont feel much. It just feels.. over. Its all over. Its over, isnt? hah. it doesnt feel like its over. today just feels like any other saturday. to be fair, My exams start next week so im still seeing my classmates. But yk, no more lessons in class. No more messing with our teachers like we used to (well i just watched but still) i dont really know what im feeling. I guess it is bittersweet, but idk if im ready to begin a new chapter of my life. Its all a blur. For once, I cant imagine anything at all. But you know what? Life moves on. Cheesy, i know, but time passes and i cant keep acting like it doesnt. I need to move on.</p>
          <p>(Wrote this para last night) ive been outside for like 13 hours (in school for 10) to the point that my home felt foreign when i stepped in it. in a way, school is more familiar to me because i only moved to this house last year but ive been in my school for 4 years. it really is a second home, im in school for like half a day. I see my teachers and classmates almost as much as my family. I feel a bit empty now. Its like ive lost a big part of myself. Of course, i know its technically not gone, but it wont be the same.</p>
          <p>honestly there is a small part of me that feels like the relationships ive formed here are not that deep. one of my juniors gave me a letter and idk.. the way they describe our friendship is how i would too and we really are not that close, but they act like we are. Id be lying id i said i didnt want to get close but realistically with the time we've spent together its no wonder we arent that close. Its my fault of course, i dont think ive put in enough effort to get to know them. This.. is a much bigger issue with my relationships i might make a separate journal entry for. Its something i reflect on regularly. In a way, going on separate paths from my friends might feel a bit.. freeing? Of course ill miss them but i might be over relying on them and i need to let go for my wings to grow.</p>

        <h3><time datetime="2025-09-05">2025-09-05</time>: post-prelim hangout</h3>
        <div class="a">
          <p>hi im writing this on the 5th early in the morning so if i refer to anything “today” it means from the 4th and as always may be incoherent =P. also when i say friends, i mean 2 of them (im not really going to distinguish between them i dont feel like it)</p>
          <p>On monday my preliminary exams ended and i had tuesday off so wednesday was the only day this week with lessons. I didnt get to talk much with my friends in person the past few weeks because it was exam period so we just came in to school for exams and i dont sit near one of my friends in class and generally we're all jusy more focussed on studying so not a lot of opportunities to talk as much. I do have a whatsapp status that i post very frequently on, which has bene my main way of sort of “communicating” or talking to my friends. ive only had one of my friends able to see my status until very recently like a few days ago i added my other friend so now both of them are able to talk about my status.</p>
          <p>When we came back to normal lessons on wednesday we talked a lot during our breaks and i laughed so much i got tired, but not in a bad way. I think adding my other friend to my status has also been a catalyst for more conversation opportunities. I sort of “interaction baited” a bit more recently, so i feel like ive been very social and talking a lot which makes me happy. Im pretty sure im an ambivert. I am a very cringe person. I am always very very late to trends and reference old/dying memes. But my friends dont judge me they laugh with me about my stupidity hehe. That day i was saying vro like all the time (i recently started using it on my status) and i started saying 67. I referenced a lot of different old memes like “*breathes in* boi” (which they somehow didnt know?? have i been too online for too long). I was laughing until i was lightheaded. My teacher wasnt teaching during one of our lessons so i played new york times games with my friend who sits near me. Also for mother tongue fortnight (you can google about mt fortnight if you are curious) my school got vendors which gave out traditional snacks which was very yummy. My school has been doing things like this a lot more this year im glad i didnt graduate any earlier ^^. My school has been pretty cool recently, not to show off or anything. But i think i feel more positive about my school than usual because i just feel more grateful i think. Im grateful for everything ive built here like my friendships (which took 4 years of small steps to this point) and just i feel HAPPY!!!!</p>
          <p>idk if other countries do this too but here we celebrate teachers' day at the end of term 3. Its fully celebration no lessons so we end school early at like 10.30am on thursday, and friday is a school holiday. This year there was a kahoot quiz in class and when our school gathered back in the school hall there was quizzes, dance and singing performances, and skits. These are all pretty standard for a celebration, it was okay. (Side tangent: the kahoot quiz was made by my class' leaders it was about our teachers which they interviewed to get answers. Some of our class takes physics and the rest takes biology, the people who made the quiz took biology. They said they didnt interview our physics teacher bc they had been told he is not very nice which is not true =( sure he looks a bit grumpy but hes not mean. Im very sad about it because it feels a bit biased, considering the person who told them that probably did not like him and eother they imposed that bias on the class leaders or the class leaders misunderstood from the physics students complaining (aka normal student behaviour), which is wrong because he didnt really do anything wrong hes just brutally honest and old =((((((()</p>
          <p>10 minutes before dismissal, the school discipline mistress was wrapping up the celebrations, then she was suddenly like “why is Mr XX sleeping”. we all looked and he was sleeping!! (btw in the school hall the students all sit on the floor but there is a gap in the middle aisle. then the teachers sit at the sides near the doors on chairs). I thought it was weird at first that she would call him out, but then he got up and started singing!! (this teacher is known to sing but it was still unexpected) then other teachers started joining in on the singing too!! suddenly a line of teachers start walking down the centre aisle of the school hall all singing and having fun. It was nice seeing the teachers have so much fun they are so silly hehe. Even most teachers at the side who didnt even have microphones were using other objects to be pretend microphones as they sang.</p>
          <p>After the celebrations, my friends and i went to the mall to eat lunch and hang out. Being with friends is really fun because we can have so much laughter just on our way to the mall. My friend wanted to show us the train tracks so we went to the end of the train. We almost got a bit lost in the big mall but we found the restaurant. When we were almost done eating we started doing food dares with the free condiments at the table. The place also gave free watermelon which i didnt really want to eat but i did. The dare was to dip it in the soya sauce and vinegar mixture my friend used on her gyoza, and it actually tasted pretty good. The watermelon didnt taste very good either so the sauce did help mask the taste, but i kept dipping again because it was GOOD!! Maybe i just like light soya sauce idk. Also i ate a drop of pure vinegar it was brutally sour.</p>
          <p>After we ate lunch we headed to this shop, idk how to describe it because it has a lot of things, but we went there because we were going to get matching rings for prom. Well, not exactly matching that theyre the same, but we bought them together. My friend and i didnt have money after lunch so our other friend had to buy it for us heh (it was their idea anyway heh). i dont have a picture of the ring right now, it's with my friend until i pay them back for it which would be like next next week after term break. If i remember i could update with its pic. When we were looking at rings, there was a ring that resembled a knot, to which my friend made a reference to omegaverse. My other friend is not as chronically online (for lack of better term) as us so i had to explain, but i couldnt do that in that cramped shop so i postponed it. </p>
          <p>There was a toy store nearby so we ended up gravitating towards it. Something about teenagers to young childrens' spaces is like a moth to a flame lol. Or maybe its just my friend group especially idk. Not much to say, we looked around made jokes about the things we saw. My friend kept touching things, which she does a lot even before, so they got #cancelled because thats gross blehhh. If i went into a toy store normally i wouldnt be having so much fun but because its with friends we were laughing so much. a lot happened i dont think i should share like every single thing we joked at.</p>
          <p>We took a quick break after looking at the toy store and when we came back we sat at a bubble tea shop so i could finally explain to my friend about omegaverse (i have explained omegaverse to then before in school a while back i guess they dont remember). It actually didnt take that long to explain.. i was finished before our drinks came. we sat at that shop drinking and talking for about an hour, which it didnt feel like. I guess time flies by when youre <del>having fun</del> <ins>talking and laughing about random and stupid shit</ins> (according to my friend). My other friend also got #cancelled for being a hypocrite (saying not to stereotype but then proceeded to stereotype) and another thing i forgot. Maybe because they are a metalhead, very cancellable /j theyre one of the good ones. But me? Heh im uncancellable (i keep saying dying memes). When we were done i had to take a break again and they checked out the cinema while i was gone. After that, the hangout had to end because it was getting a bit late, like 6pm already (we were there from 1pm i think). It was very fun being with them. Even the way home was fun talking to them. We said our goodbyes and it was over.</p>
          <p>Despite it being over, for some reason i didnt feel as much dread as i usually do. A lot of times after hangouts the feeling after is very bittersweet. Throughout the hangout i did feel like i was a bit tired, physically and mentally, which is very normal for me. But then my friends say something funny and i light up all over again. The cool thing about trios is that when im tired they can just entertain each other and i can join back in when ive got more energy. Today i didnt feel like i was using more energy than i shouldve like i usually feel, its like being with my friends makes me more energised. Im also more confident in our friendship, like we really are friends and i can confidently call them that. We are friends!! i have friends and its the two of them!! Hehe it makes me stupidly happy. I was so happy i cried that night (there was something else that also pushed me to cry but this was the main reason). I feel like im grateful for the gifts ive been given which have allowed me to feel this euphoric. Its the next day and im still happy!! No dread!! Very nice. Well, after this i have to study but i have decided today i will redo my website instead (still hiatus) but tomorrow onwards i will try to study because my real final exams are in october. Its the last stretch, i just need to make it!!</p>
          <p>i posted some pics from today on <a target="_blank" href="https://pikidiary.lol/posts/258296">pikidiary</a></p>

        <h3><time datetime="2025-07-21">2025-07-21</time>: reflection</h3>
        <div class="a">
          <p>ive been reflecting on my webdevving journey a bit recently. i think there were a lot of little things that slowly accumulated and contributed to me eventually deciding to learn html and make a neocities website. the start is a bit blurry so it may be out of order but ill try my best to recover the details from my memory.</p>
          <p>lets see.. perhaps it all started with pinterest. i started seeing old tech stuff like keyboards and crt tvs and i found like quite cute. i used those images to decorate one of my notion pageas. though i wasnt sure how to make those images with the screen cut out an overlay (i dont know if thats even possible in notion?). because i kept saving those types of things i started getting shown <i>old web</i> stuff and really liked it. i loved the glossy texture of frutiger aero and the windows xp ui. yeah i was like <i>that</i>. this is where i wouldve first seen stamps but i didnt actually know what stamps were lol. i think old me was really into the aesthetic of the old web but now im honestly kinda neutral on it. im on the indie web now cuz i dont like mainstream social media, the aesthetic isnt really a factor for me. i mean, my site is hardly old web inspired and i prefer sites that arent old web inspired too. i like being in the present, the indie web isnt limited to the 00s.</p>
          <p>ahh anyway other than that i think the next stop in my journey is everskies! i joined everskies in june 2024 (and all of what is in the previous paragraph is like earlier in 2024 i think). actually maybe everskies came first idk i dont remember im not going to reorder this. so on everskies you have your profile and its totally customisable, even allowing html and css. thats how i first heard of these coding languages. i really wanted a cool profile and all the really good ones seemed to be handcoded. uhh i ended up kind if abandoning everskies though, i dont play it anymore except occasionally to make an outfit or something. everskies is how i heard of html but it isnt really what got me into it.</p>
          <p>i genuinely dont remember how i heard of neocities actually. like i genuinely dont even know all i remember is signing up for an account and being surprised that my username was my domain and that it automatically made a site. i just made an account to follow websites and for like the future when i decide to actually get around to html then be ready to really make the website. so while i dont know how i found neocities i do know what sort of pushed me to actually start. i saw luvstarkei's video on <a target=“_blank” href=“https://youtu.be/uNlZ50b6wSs”>why you should make a website</a> and i thought yeah maybe i should. wait i think this is out of order maybe i saw the video first then made a neocities.. sorry this isnt very cohesive my memory is a mess. anyway that video was definitely a driving factor because i think at the time i was craving something new to make, some new hobby to pick up and webdev seemed kind of exciting. especially after some neocities exploration, i really wanted my own site like everyone else. i would say my main inspo would be monsieurdoll (the GOAT n maybe really obvious based on my homepagea design lol). other sites inspired me too but when i first started out i think i accidentally really just wanted to copy monsieurdoll and maybe snooped in his code a bit.. (DONT DO THIS i mean inspecting isnt wrong n while the only code i directly copied was a linear-gradient one time i think when it comes to inspos, theyre your crutch at the start to help you flourish on your own when you eventually outgrow them, yaknow? idk like inspos are there for you to build on it to make it your own)</p>
          <p>in like october-november my end of year exams were over so i finally had time to pick up html. i started on we3schools (the goat for beginners but i think its about time i brush up and go to mdn webdocs cuz its more in depth). and really tried to play around. i remember showing my friends something i made in the try-it editor but the most complicated things i had learnt at that point was like, tooltips and hyperlink images. they werent impressed. i dont plan on showing them my site now so idk ig theyll never know how goated my coding is now (ik im still technically beginner-intermediate but shhh). i was really into it for a few days straight then i had a long period of not learning. i think i finished the html course in like december then i finally moved on to css which took a while too but finally being able to work on my site was my main motivation. i think i made it like media queries before i gave up and just started because i was ITCHINGGG. so i just up and started.</p>
          <p>i know i uploaded my first site in march 2025 so i mustve started working on it a bit before. it definitely took a bit longer than how long it takes me now simply because well i was a beginner. i can make a homepagea in like a day or two now but that first one took me at least a week or something maybe a good while. and it was a wip too the bottom divs were wips (i still do this lol uploading my homepagea with wips). oh it probably also took longer because school had started already so i was a bit busier than i was in december. idk at what point but eventually i did finish the css course properly (though i didnt really retain the latter parts since theyre more complicated). i did try to learn javascript after that but umm variables was so boring i stopped (i will learn in the future though its not if, but when). i had that site for about three months until june when i became really dissatisfied with it. it wasnt justcthe layout but i also really hated the name which was the same as the email i used for it and my other socials connected to it so i just purged it all. purged the site, purged the socials, purged the email.</p>
          <p>i made a new one which is what you are currently on! i started this site in early july and actually made the home pagea in 14 hours straight lol (started at 7pm finished at 9am. please dont do that its not good for you my sleep schedule is horrible). at the moment i actually really want to remake my home pagea and also all my subpageas too (again -_-“). i have a second site on nekoweb in the works and i think it has made it a bit clearer what i want this site to be thematically in order for me to pull this off. yeah i havent technically been into this whole indie web thing for that long, its only been a year but it really feels like ive grown an attachment to this scene and really enjoy the process of maintaining my site.</p>
          <p>in conclusion umm remember your roots or whatever idk.</p>

        <h3><time datetime="2025-07-07">2025-07-07</time>: post-graduation plans</h3>
        <div class="a">
          <p>haiz this my first journal entry..! um so im 16 from singapore which means im going to be taking my big boss finals this year in october-november. the results can determine what path i go down and generally the culture in my country is really stressful when it comes to education. im really bad at time management and prioritisation, i mean im working on this site instead of doing my homework and studying. and im struggling to keep up a bit in school too so i really should focus on my studies. so to motivate myself ive thought of sum stuff i can do once its all over and my holidays starts.</p>
          <p>i can learn javascript!! i mean i can now but i want to focus on it properly which i cant rn. i wanna learn js stuff to pimp up dis boring static site. umm unfortunately im not a big fan of auto animations like gifs and autoplay music so its likely i wont include those kinda things. thats why you will probably see little to no gifs/marquees on this site unless its a little hidden. but js could really help with sum technical stuff and formatting this site.</p>
          <p>i can get a part time job! is it weird? idk its not just about money i also think i will waste all my time if i dont have something im somewhat forced to do so a part time job will be good and i could get sum cash. although.. the problem is im kind of a super shy recluse and short with an unfriendly face so i would need to find a job that doesnt need a lot of customer interaction or anything. maybe some sort of sorting or packaging job would be gud! and i like to do repetitive tasks heh.</p>
          <p>on top of pt, i could also try to hone my art skills and open commissions! idk who would want to buy from me tho.. and im not that open online, i dont have a big presence so idk how ppl would even know about me unless i post in a discord or smth. im also under 18 so the only form of payment i can except is robux or giftcards, and i think id want the giftcards. idk if id be confident enough in my art to do comms but smth ill think about.</p>
          <p>i also just wanna work on my hobbies in general, like sewing. i wanna make more stuff cuz making my own stuff is really fun having the end result. my own unique accessory. also i dont really online shop so if i want a certain accessory sumtimes its easier and cheaper to just make it myself. in general, i just wanna make more stuff. i also wanna consume more stuff. i feel like i “never have time” to watch shows or play games but its actually i just waste the time. i wanna get into stuff more, it might make me more inspired.</p>
          <p>last but not least, i wanna take care of my healh better. im short, but its probably partially due to how little i eat. my diet is very bad and i eat very irregularly. i also stay at home a lot and dont exercise so im very unfit. i want to change that. i want to at least go on walks regularly, nothing too complicated like going to the gym. just going outside it something i need to do more. and maybe also improve my sleep schedule bc its really bad rn.</p>
          <p>yeah thats the stuff ive thought of rn that i wanna do after my finals/graduate. im really uncertain about my future beyond this year. like i genuinely cannot imagine what ill be doing because im still undecided on what institution i want to go to. but im sure ill figure it out eventually. perhaps if im serious about web development i could go down that path? i doubt it, honestly i think this is just a hobby. oh also i want to get my own laptop. currently i code on my family's computer but its really full so i can never do my own stuff like get games on it. i wanna get my own laptop so i can do my own stuff heh. anyway thats it byee</p>
