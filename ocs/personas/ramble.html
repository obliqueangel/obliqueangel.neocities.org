          <p>listen im just making this convenient for myself i dont care that much about vampire lore.
            <ul>
              <li>vampires dont burn in the sun they are just weakened</li>
              <li>a drop of blood can go a long way. vampires dont really need to feed often and if they do its driven by greed</li>
              <li>people can be turned into vampires but most are born one</li>
              <li>wip</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>there is no story. ok what i mean by that is i dont plan on making a comprehensive story with extensive lore or anything for this OC universe. the simple reason is that these are my personas, they represent me. theyre more of figures than fleshed out characters for me and thats how i want it and will keep it. maybe this is just me trying to avoid coming up with lore but i mean it would be weird for me if i write in experiences for aime and aimee that i personally have not gone through. while i do make media for them which may have bits of lore, for the most part any story i make with them is not canon and subject to changes. the only canon thing is that aimee falls from heaven and meets aime. the details of that interaction are also a bit ambiguous for now which i like because i can change it any time i want. so this is just to say dont expect any lore from this OC universe. its just me playing with myself basically.</p>
