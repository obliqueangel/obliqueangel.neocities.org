        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>A mysterious entity who fell from the sky. A loner among angels who decided to seek leisure elsewhere. She had been eyeing Earth for centuries before she came down and was captivated by the natural sights. She is aloof and stoic, generally having a blank expression. She is straightforward in her words and may take things too seriously or literally. As an angel, an otherworldly being, she is unaware if the typical customs of Earthly beings. She is held down to Earth by a weighted belt which she removes when she returns to the sky. She usually works at night so she has free time during the day to spend time on Earth.</p>
