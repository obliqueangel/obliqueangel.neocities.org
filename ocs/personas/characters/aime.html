        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>Aimé is a young vampire who lives alone. He is known among other vampires as a "day riser" as he prefers to be awake during the day rather than the night like most vampires. He tends to stay indoors or around his home most of the time, rarely venturing too far out. He could be considered a NEET, using his computer too much during the day and does not get enough sleep neither during the night nor day time.</p>
        <p>He is very insecure and can be quite pessimistic. Due to his isolation, he lacks social and communication skills and finds it  difficult to connect with others, whether vampire or not. He has trouble expressing himself and tends to ramble or speak unclearly.</p>

          <h3><a href="aimee.html">Aimée</a></h3>
          <p>Aimée accidentally stepped into a hole in the clouds while observing Earth and fell through. She dropped into the ocean, unconscious.  Aimée suddenly awoke </p>

          <p>As Aimé was walking along the beach to watch the sunrise, he noticed a body washed up on the shore. Upon closer inspection, this “person” was not breathing so he panicked. Aimé arduously carried the person home and helped it recover after it had awoken. It kept floating from time to time so Aimé gave it a weighted belt to stay on the ground. This person had no name so Aimé called it "Aimée" as he assumed it was female due to its appearance. While Aimée was recovering, the pair visited many sights and frolicked in many fields. They especially enjoyed cloudwatching and exploring nature. Once Aimée had recovered, she revealed to Aimé that she was actually an angel. She then removed her weighted belt and flew back to heaven.</p>
          <p>Aimé thought he had lost a new friend, until one day Aimée suddenly returned. She told him</p>
